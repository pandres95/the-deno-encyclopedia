### Design Goals

- The approach for this book series requires a fresh style. Not being another
  _"Pro Book of «insert your tech stack here»"_
- It should introduce people step by step without causing a burden or stressing
  out the reader. This book series intends to encourage binge-reading and be a
  series of reference textbooks.
- In conclusion: storytelling is KEY.

## Book Series

### Part 1: Fundamentals

#### Outline

- **Book Title** The Deno Encyclopaedia / Part 1: Fundamentals (stylised as
  _“the deno encyclopedia / part 1: fundamentals”_)
- **Subtitle** A book series that guides you into the depths of Deno runtime and
  its quirks.
- **Tagline** In this book, you’ll understand JavaScript enough and start
  working on your first projects using Deno. Also, you’ll discover why Deno is
  there and how it can be powerful to use it professionally.
- **Target Audience** This book is for programming students, and professionals
  with little to no knowledge of technologies related to JavaScript.˝
- **Book Description** This part aims to be an introduction to the universe of
  Deno, which is, so far, the best competitor in the JavaScript server-side
  runtimes market. Introduces a brief history of Javascript in a way no one gets
  asleep while reading, showing why Deno is the way to go.

  Once having read this book, they'll be able to use Deno to code basic
  applications effectively. Also, they'll be ready to get into the depths of the
  runtime itself.
- **Key Features** A reader should learn the fundamentals of Deno.

  This knowledge is essential to prepare them to be familiar with the runtime
  and progress without fear.

  The learning process of this book is a project-based approach, complemented by
  guidelines on how to explore the book. I can further improve the methodology
  in the following books (remember, this is my first book, and well... need to
  learn to do things right. Right?)

- **Competition Analysis (and possible future sources and references)**
  > _Strong points:_ Although writing this book in English primarily, I'm
  > feeling ready to translate it to Spanish, getting an entry point to a yet
  > unexplored market so that I can be a reference to native Spanish speakers.
