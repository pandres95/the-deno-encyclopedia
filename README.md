## Book Series

### Part 1: Fundamentals

#### Outline

**Book Title** The Deno Encyclopaedia / Part 1: Fundamentals (stylised as _“the
deno encyclopedia / part 1: fundamentals”_)

**Subtitle** A book series to guide you into the depths of Deno runtime, and its
quirks.

**Tagline** In this book, you’ll understand JavaScript enough, and start working
on your first projects using Deno. Also, you’ll discover why Deno is there, and
how it can be powerful to use it professionally.

**Target Audience** This book is intended to programming students, and
professionals with little to no knowledge of technologies related to
JavaScript.˝

**Book Description** This part aims to be an introduction to the universe of
Deno, which is so far, the best competitor in the JavaScript server-side
runtimes market. Introduces to a brief history of Javascript, in a way no one
gets asleep while reading. And then showing why Deno is the way to go.

Once a reader finishes this book, they'll be able to effectively use Deno to
code basic applications, and will be ready to get into the depths of the runtime
itself.

**Key Features**

A reader should learn the fundamentals of Deno.

This is important to prepare them to be familiar with the runtime, and progress
without fear.

The learning process is a project-based approach, complemented by guidelines of
how to explore the book. This methodology would be improved furthen in the
following books (remember this is my first book and well... need to learn to do
things right. Right?)

_Strong points:_ Although writing this book in english primarily, I'm feeling
ready to translate it to spanish, getting an entrypoint to a yet unexplored
market, so I can be a reference to native spanish speakers.
