3. Why Deno?
    1. Differences between Deno and Node
    2. Advantages of using Deno
        - Standard: Wide usage of Standardised Web APIs by default.
        - Security: The sandboxed context execution
        - TS by Default
        - Full ESM implementation
        - Compatible with Node
        - Fast
    3. Use cases
        - More "native" Web Development
        - Interoperability with Rust
        - Plugin-based architectures
    4. Going further: Recommended communities around Deno
4. Hello World
    1. Your toolbox
        - Installing deno
        - Setting up VSCode to work with Deno
        - Formatting
        - Linting
    2. console.log('Hello, deno ðŸ¦•');
        - Using the REPL
        - Writing your first script in Deno
    3. Importing libraries
        - https://deno.land/x
        - https://esm.sh
        - [Using npm packages](4.3-importing-libraries/using-npm-packages/README.md)
        - Using import maps sort things out
    4. Managing permissions with Deno
5. First steps with Deno
    > Since this is a series of projects, it'll be best to keep the structure open at first, and start defining them as I start working on them
    > Also, this will serve as the starting point to build more complex projects as long as the books progresses
    0. Writing tests, piece of cake
        - Assertion libraries
        - Using BDD
    1. Getting data from APIs using `fetch`
