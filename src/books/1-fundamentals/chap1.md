# Introduction

## A brief history class

<!---
    TODO: Introduce the history of Javascript, from the creation to the language,
    until today.

    Emphasize the nuances of the history, and focus on the history of JS being
    a history related to the history of the web, of visionaries and dreamers, all
    of them wanting to push the limits of web technologies, the future of
    the Internet itself, and beyond.

The history behind Javascript is the history of vision and greed, of building a
community, and, most importantly, of the web itself.

Lots of people and companies have been around since the beginning when Brendan
Eich first developed Javascript in 1995. He was working at Netscape, one of the
major web browsers of the era.

Naturally, it's a common misconception to think Java is related to Javascript.
Also, you might think the language behind the conception of our dearest
programming language is Java (because, of course, the name's in it!).

So, be surprised to know that other languages were a huge influence.

Among them was [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language);
but also you can find [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme), which
inspired the functional paradigm features you find in Javascript, and
[Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self), from where it gets one of its most
powerful features: **the prototype-based nature of its objects**, which we'll
explore in the next chapter.
